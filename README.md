## What is bridgED?

Canada, without a doubt, is one of the greatest countries to live in. Maple Syrup. Hockey. Tim Hortons. Exceptional nice-ness. But perhaps what makes us most Canadian, is our true appreciation of multiculturalism.

Many of us are or have families which have traveled far and wide to be a part of this great country. Lately, this has become even more common, with many refugees choosing the safety of our borders. But as receptive as Canada has been, there still exist difficulties for these individuals, many of whom have little prior exposure to English.

Introducing, bridgED. Fast, practical, and educational translations allow our new friends to understand the environment around them, right from one of the most universally used tools, our phones.

Using IBM’s Watson visual recognition and language translator, we’re able to identify and then translate objects. Utilizing photos not only make it faster than typing, but it allows the identification of items without obvious translations in native tongue. Convenient descriptions and wiki links allow them to then quickly understand the object on a deeper level; making bridgED a speedy learning alternative, especially for those who find it difficult to learn the language on a formal level, like many hard-working workers who lack the time.

But of course, this may still not be a totally practical alternative, given the time spent raising and lowering the phone. That’s why we also have a soon-to-be-integrated feature utilizing AR, to provide near instant translations, optimal for travel. High-importance signs such as “Dead-End”, tourist areas with a high-density of unique cultural goods, or a way to quickly understand the variety of local cuisine; are all things that bridgED can help with.

bridgED was designed with goal to help keep us all together. Because what’s better than enjoying Tim’s, poutine, and hockey? It’s doing it through the collective understanding of a nation united among differences. Eh?
